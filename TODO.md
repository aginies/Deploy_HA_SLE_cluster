# TODO

* Better clean up (don't leave disks lying around, don't destroy pools
that may be used by others, release IP addresses)

* Don't replace /etc/hosts config for other scenarios

* Don't destroy pools etc. before configuring, since other scenarios
may share pools

* Geo bootstrap for geo scenario

* Cluster tests / run wizards
